Simple Android app for logging your energy level throughout the day.

Right now, it just sets an alarm that rings every hour and asks you what your energy level is then logs in into a sqlite database. Then when you open the app, you see the energy levels you logged each day. I want to add graphs and analysis eventually.

Project is set up to be used with IntelliJ.
